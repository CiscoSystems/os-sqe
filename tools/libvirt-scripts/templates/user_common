# Cobbler can instruct nodes being provisioned to start a Puppet agent

#
# Note that any other valid MySQL config file parameters can be added as

## NFS Live migration options ##
# If on a debian-based distro, you must also set the nova uid/gid

# as they predefine the uid/gid.

# You can also manage the nova user's uid and gid. You will have to enable

## Cisco plugin settings
# Uncomment and adjust the lines below if you wish to use the Cisco
# Nexus plugin.  Make sure you also:
# 1.) Set the tenant_network_type (vlan or gre) in
#     ../global_hiera_params/common.yaml
# 2.) Set the network_vlan_ranges to the vlan range you want to use
#     in hiera_data/tenant_network_type/vlan.yaml if using vlans
#     for tenant segmentation (as opposed to GRE).
# 3.) Add these two lines to ../class_groups/network_controller.yaml:
#     - "coe::nexus"
#     - "neutron::plugins::cisco"
# 4.) Uncomment the "Cisco plugin support" section of the
#     ../data_mappings/common.yaml file.
# 5.) Because the Ubuntu init scripts assume only one plugin will
#     be used, if you are using the Cisco plugin and OVS together
#     you may need to start neutron manually rather than via an init
#     script.  The command is:

#     --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/cisco/cisco_plugins.ini \
#     --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/openvswitch/ovs_neutron_plugin.ini


# Use the Cisco plugin.  Note that we set this here rather than in
# global_hiera_params because in most use cases we'll want to set up
# both the Cisco plugin and the OVS plugin (and because the
# Cisco plugin by itself is agentless).

#nexus_credentials:
#  - '172.18.117.27/admin/password'
